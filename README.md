# Stock Analysis with VBA

I decided to use VBA scripting to analyze a large stock market dataset.  For loops were key for data retrieval and organization in order to visualize ticker symbols, total stock volumes, open/close prices, yearly changes in volume and percent change in volume over one year.  Conditional formatting, with VBA, was layered to color positive changes in green and negative changes in red.
